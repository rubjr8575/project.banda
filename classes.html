				<ol>
					<li>We admitted we were powerless over our problems and that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
					<li>Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
					<li>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood him.</li>
					<li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
					<li>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
					<li>We were entirely ready to have God remove these defects of character.</li>
					<li>We humbly asked God to remove our Shortcomings.</li>
					<li>We made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
					<li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
					<li>Continued to take personal inventory and we were wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
					<li>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our consciuos contact with God , praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
					<li>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to others , and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</li>
